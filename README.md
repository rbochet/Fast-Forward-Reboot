Fast Forward Reboot
===================

Just a small app which allows you to restart quickly your **rooted** Android phone.

Restart a phone using the Android standard reboot procedure takes ages (especially on a SGS), and I need to restart mine often for developing purposes. 

It uses the system's `reboot` command, that's why you need root access.


Works fine with

* HTC G1
* Samsung Galaxy S
* Huawei Ideos

Fork and patch if you want to add something, I'll be glad to merge it back.
